                            Orchard will provide a service that will help the user 
                            complete daily goals to save money. Each goal will have 
                            a growth tree and every time you save up for the goal. 
                            The tree will create an animation of your progress on the 
                            goal. Daily friendly reminders to remember to save money. 
                            A list that will hold all your goal names, deadlines, and 
                            amounts. (It will act as a budget list for all your saving 
                            goals.) Every time you aim to save money towards your 
                            budgeting goals you can earn points each time you update it.
                             If you earn enough points, you can receive special badges 
                             for the user as an incentive for saving. Itâ€™s operated 
                             similarly to the mechanics of a video game.
